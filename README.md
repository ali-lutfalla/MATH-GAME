### ***Description*** 
#### The math game project is a quiz game that let the user choose the settings for the game that includes the difficulty for the game that vary from easy, mid, hard, mix for random difficuty from these three that I just mentioned also the user must choose the type of operator type for the questions like '-' , '+', '*', '/' , or mix to choose a random one every round like the difficulty, also the user should specify how many rounds does the game contain keeping in mind the win/loss policy is answering right answers more than the wrong one or equal score to win but if it's lower you lose. The game generate the questions in multiple choice questions style where the user got only one chance to answer and it does count for wrong or correct answers and the user will be notified about the answer if it's correct or not and if not the correct answer will be displayed to the user. I chose to create this game because it allows me to utilize objects to store data and there's potential for more development and ideas for it.
